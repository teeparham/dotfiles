- React components: src/components/**/*.tsx
- Documentation: docs/**/*.md
- Configuration files: *.config.{js,json}

- Multiple files: dist/**/*, docs/**/*.md

## Required Fields

### Frontmatter
- description: ACTION TRIGGER OUTCOME format
- globs: `glob pattern for files and folders`
- alwaysApply: {true or false} - when true will be attached to every conversation

- requirements: Actionable items

- critical-rules: summary of short rule bullets that are the most critical to abide by

## Formatting Guidelines
- Use Concise Markdown primarily
- Use some XML tags limited to:
  - <example>
  - <danger>
  - <required>
- Always indent content within XML or nested XML tags by 2 spaces
- Emojis and Mermaid diagrams are allowed if it is not redundant and better explains the rule for the AI comprehension.

## Critical Rules
- Keep frontmatter description under 120 characters while maintaining clear intent for rule selection by AI Agent
- Keep the rule DRY - do not repeat or be overly explanetory.
- Use succinct markdown the agent can easily understand.
- The front matter must always have description, globs, and alwaysApply, even if the value is null
- Use standard glob patterns without quotes (e.g., *.js, src/**/*.ts)
- Try to keep the total rule line count under 50, better under 25 lines, unless there are diagrams or longer required examples.
- Always include a valid and invalid example
- Quotes are not needed around glob patterns
